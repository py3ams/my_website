<p>I grew up in Jersey in the Channel Islands, where I attended <a class="external_links" href="http://www.delasalle.ac.je/"> De La Salle College</a>, achieving A-Levels in Mathematics, Physics, History and French. In September 2003 I began an M.Phys. degree in Mathematics and Physics at the <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/">University of Bath</a>. <%= image_tag("graduation.jpg", :alt => "Aaron_M_Smith", :id => 'graduation_picture') %>This included a year spent working in industry at <a href="http://www.mbda-systems.com/">MBDA</a> in Filton, Bristol. During the final year of my degree I undertook a project under the supervision of Dr. Philippe Blondel, on the reflection of sonar from targets on the sea bed. The data analysis we carried out was later included in a paper presented by Dr. Blondel at the Second International Conference on Underwater Acoustic Measurements at Heraklion, Crete, in June 2007 (P. Blondel, D. Fang, A. Smith, N. Jayasundere; "High-frequency bistatic imaging of proud targets - Influence of target orientation and target type").</p>

<p>Graduating from Bath with first-class honours, I was able to continue my studies at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, joining the <a href="http://www.lsi.ox.ac.uk/">LSI DTC</a> in September 2007. I spent the first year of my D.Phil studying a range of biological topics, including bioinformatics, biological physics, medical imaging and computational biology. I then completed two short projects in the summer of 2008, beginning in the Department of Statistics with 'An analysis of DNA word usage in yeast and human'. The second project was based at the Centre for Mathematical Biology (CMB), entitled 'Modelling rosette formation during cell migration in the mouse embryo'. Upon completion of these projects I moved full-time to the CMB to continue my research towards a D.Phil, which I completed in April 2012.</p>

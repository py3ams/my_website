<p>I have always been fascinated by languages and communication. During my PhD I published two articles in well-known journals (PLoS Biology and Journal of Mathematical Biology) as well as participating in the peer-review process myself on behalf of PLoS Computational Biology. As well as writing my own 200-page <%= link_to "thesis", "Thesis_Aaron_Smith.pdf" %>, I also enjoyed regularly proofreading my colleagues' work. More recently, I have been working as an editor for <%= link_to "MyDocumate", "http://www.mydocumate.com"%>, a China-based company that offers a range of English language services to both business and students.</p>

<p>I am currently taking courses in linguistics and grammar at <%= link_to "Uppsala University", "http://www.uu.se"%>, as well as attending and hosting regular conversation groups in English, Swedish and Spanish through the <%= link_to "Meetup", "http://www.meetup.com" %> website. Along with my partner, a native Spanish speaker from Mexico, I have also worked as a Spanish-English translator. We recently translated the website of the Federation of Practitioners of Yoga at 42o (Bikram Yoga); as well as the first edition of their magazine.</p>

<p>I am able to edit or proofread scientific articles, personal statements, essays, theses, and CVs. Please <a class="external_links" href="mailto:aaron@aaronsmith.co.uk">contact me</a> with your enquiry, stating clearly the type of text, the number of words, and the level of service required. I will get back to you as quickly as possible with a quote.</p>
